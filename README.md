## As an app user, I want to be able to search for recipes that use specific ingredients that I have, so that I can find new and creative ways to use them.

## As an admin, I want to be able to add new recipes to the app, so that users have access to a wide variety of recipes.

## As an admin, I can modify the recipe details, and also can add and delete ingredients to a recipe.

## As an app user of the recipe app, I want to be able to leave reviews for recipes that I have tried, so that I can share my experience with other users and help them decide whether or not to try the recipe themselves.
